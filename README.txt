Configurer class

This class is intended to be used as a mixin to your classes.
It reads and writes configuration files based on attributes present in
an INI file and your classes.
See the api.txt file to see more details of its usage.

If you want to look right away in the code, there is an example and the
module itself.

Contributions are very appreciated.

If you want to install the module globally, a setup script is provided.
$ python setup.py install
